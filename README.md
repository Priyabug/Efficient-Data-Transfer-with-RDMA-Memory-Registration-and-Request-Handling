<h1>Implementation of remote DNS cache poisoning</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
Efficient data transfer mechanisms are essential for high-performance computing (HPC) and modern distributed systems. Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) enables direct memory access between the memory spaces of different machines without involving the operating system, resulting in ultra-low latency and high throughput communication. This concept is particularly relevant in scenarios like large-scale data processing, cloud computing, and networked storage systems.

The implementation of efficient RDMA-based data transfer involves two critical processes: memory registration and request handling. These processes are designed to optimize the use of RDMA by minimizing overhead and ensuring seamless communication.
